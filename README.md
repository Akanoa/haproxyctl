About
-----

HAProxyctl is a tool to control the various aspects of HAProxy that can be controlled by means of its socket. Things like disabling/enabling a server, modify weights (coming soon), gathering stats and info, all using a simple client interface. A library can also be used to embed HAProxy control inside other Python programs.
